The Image Gallery project is a simple web application that allows users to view and interact with a collection of images. The gallery is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
HTML defines the layout ofthe gallery, such as the grid of images.
CSS is used to style the images, making the gallery visually appealing, including hover effects that highlight images when the user interacts with them.
JavaScript adds functionality like clicking on an image to open it in a larger view or to navigate between images.
This project showcases core front-end skills and can be extended by adding more features like filters, animations, or transitions.
